# Customer Purchase Prediction Using Consumer Behavior Dataset with an ANN Model (Deep Learning)

## This project focuses on predicting future purchases based on customer behavior using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model with python on Jupyter. By leveraging historical transaction data, the model identifies patterns to predict whether a customer is likely to make a purchase, enabling businesses to optimize marketing strategies and improve customer engagement.

## The workflow involves the following steps:
### Data Loading: 
#### Importing and organizing the consumer behavior dataset to prepare it for analysis.
### Data Preprocessing: 
#### Cleaning the data, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables to ensure high-quality inputs.
### Data Splitting: 
#### Dividing the dataset into training and testing subsets to objectively evaluate the modelâ€™s performance.
### Data Scaling: 
#### Normalizing feature values to standardize data, enhancing model training and convergence.
### Model Building & Training: 
#### Constructing the ANN model with appropriate layers, activation functions, optimizers, and loss functions, followed by training the model on the processed data.
### Prediction and Evaluation: 
#### Generating predictions on the test set and assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
